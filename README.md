### Vision statement: what is it?
A vision is a future state of being for an individual, a team, a department, an organization, a community, a nation, or the world. It is an idea, a way of being that captures the minds and hearts of people. In the words of Stephen Covey, it is "beginning with the end in mind." It appeals to the best in people, motivating them to contribute to something greater than themselves and to deliver outputs that will make positive differences in the lives of others. It is the mechanism that elicits a sense of selflessness, putting team goals first, ahead of personal goals. In turn, individuals have their needs met as they contribute selflessly to team goals. Vision purposes are noble and worthy of individual effort. Visions energize.

### Why having a vision is important?
A business vision provides a continuum of services to meet the needs of those entrusted to our care, creating a safe and professional environment with the outcome of reduced victimization, safer communities and an emphasis on the premium of life.
